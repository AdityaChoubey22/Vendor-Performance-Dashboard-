# Vendor-Performance-Dashboard-
This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing datasets to uncover meaningful insights. It demonstrates the full data analysis workflow — from raw data ingestion to visualization — using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
- Apply statistical methods and visualizations to interpret results.
- Build interactive dashboards or reports for clear presentation of findings.

  
Features
- Modular and reusable Python scripts for data workflows.
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations.
- Visualizations that highlight key metrics and patterns.
- Scalable design for adapting to different datasets.

  
Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (optional for ML tasks)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI/Excel (for visualization extensions)
